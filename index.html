		<p>The brain is what causes us to live, function, and to communicate and computate. The brain can process 400 billion bits of information a second.</p>

		<p>This is a model of the brain. It accurately depicts the parts of the brain and their functions(remember I have everything linked at the bottom if you want
		to check it out. The reasons humans are different in terms of the brain than other animals is the prefontal lobe. This section of the brain deals with
		conciousness and is a combination of all of our senses. It is what makes us aware and allows us to think. This part of the brain distincts us from other animals
		because of this reason. Another section of the brain, called the hypothalamus, is responsible for the regulation of body temperature and releasing hormones(which I
		will get to later.) This is a very important part of the brain like the prefontal lobe but the reason this is important is it keeps us from overheating and causes the body to release
		sweat when needed. Whenever the body gets cold, the hypothalamus sends signals to the rest of the brain and body to tell the muscles to move around and produce heat to keep from having a 
		condition known as hypothermia(an extreme low in body temperature.) The hypothalamus also keeps us from getting hyperthermia(an extreme high in body temperature.)</p>
